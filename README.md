## Overview

This repository contains code implementations for various DSA topics in C++ such as linked lists, arrays, graphs, queues, stacks, recursion, sorting algorithms, and more.

Each folder corresponds to a specific data structure or algorithm and contains relevant code and explanations.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **LinkedList**: Basic operations and problems related to Linked Lists.
- **arrays**: Array operations and algorithms.
- **graphs**: Graph-related algorithms, such as BFS, DFS, etc.
- **hashing**: Hashing techniques and problems.
- **heap**: Implementation of heaps and related algorithms.
- **matrices**: Matrix operations and algorithms.
- **queue**: Queue data structure and problems.
- **recursion**: Recursive algorithms and problems.
- **sorting**: Different sorting algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, etc.
- **stack**: Stack data structure and related problems.
- **strings**: String manipulation algorithms.
- **structures**: Various data structures and their implementations.
- **template**: Template-based algorithms and code.
- **tree**: Tree-related data structures like Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.
- **vectors**: Vector operations and problems.

Each folder contains an **Initial commit** as a starting point for each section.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: The code is written in C++ for the implementation of data structures and algorithms.
- **Git**: Version control for tracking changes and maintaining history.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joshi-parwaaz/My_DSA_CODE.git

2. Navigate to the respective folder for the data structure/algorithm you want to explore:

  ```bash
  cd My_DSA_CODE/linkedList  # Example for LinkedList folder

3. Compile and run the C++ code (if using a C++ compiler):

  ```bash
  g++ <filename>.cpp -o <outputfile>
  ./<outputfile>

### Key Points:
- I've made sure that each section is properly formatted with headings.
- Code blocks are wrapped inside triple backticks (```) with `bash` for commands and `cpp` for C++ code, as appropriate.
- The "How to Use" section now correctly includes the commands and steps.
